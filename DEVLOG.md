### 2025-01-06 - Updating documentation, creating code files
Updated proposal and readme with all necessary info. Done during class time (40 min). Created skeleton files for project including function headers. Done for HW (30 min).

### 2025-01-07 - Save and quit from the text editor
Looked into ncurses documentation and figured out how to intercept keyboard input. Set up basic function to ask the user if they want to save their changes (quit if not), then ask the user for the file name before quitting if Ctrl+Q is pressed. (40 min)
